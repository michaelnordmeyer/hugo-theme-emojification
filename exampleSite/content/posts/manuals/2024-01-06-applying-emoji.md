An emoji has to be declared in frontmatter's `icon` or `hugo.toml`’s `icon`. It’s just pasting it at the right place. That’s it.

This page’s relevant YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
params:
  icon: 🤩
---
```

This site’s relevant TOML config:

```toml
---
[params]
  icon = '🌳'
---
```

If there’s no `icon` in the frontmatter and no default icon set, then there will be no icon displayed and the home link won’t be click- or tapable anymore. Only the [access key](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/accesskey) remains (h).

If icons for a limited number of pages should be hidden, [it can be done](/manuals/hiding-icons/) as well.

[Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) provides design views for a chosen emoji for many operating systems and software, as those look different on different platforms.
